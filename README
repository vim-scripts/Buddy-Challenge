There are two versions of this script because MAC vs. Windows is slightly different the keyboard mappings.  On Windows, when you press Alt-z or Alt-i  the vim editor plays brain games with you about what's under the cursor.  On MAC it's Cmd-z or Cmd-i

Tip:: 
in Windows you can make AutoHotKey (*) press Alt-i for you when you press Middle Mouse: 

  MButton::
  Click
  Sleep,200
  Send,!i
  return

just paste these lines into an .ahk script e.g "mybutton.ahk" and Right-click context menu in explorer --> Run Script when you've installed AutoHotKey. Get it from www.autohotkey.com.  AutoHotKey is a very easy to use macro style programming language.  It is superb at trapping keys, mice, and joysticks. And no I don't work for AutoHotKey
